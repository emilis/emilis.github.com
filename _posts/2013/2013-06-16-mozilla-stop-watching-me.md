I have signed the [StopWatching.Us](https://optin.stopwatching.us/) letter today. I am not a US citizen, so even if the letter succeeds, I don't think my privacy will improve substantially. But at least I did something.

I am not sure what could solve the current privacy crisis and return our rights back. I think that lobbyism is only part of a possible successful solution, because a big part of the problem is a very technological one.

Consider piracy. It is a complex problem, but part of it is that copying and transferring copyrighted data is so cheap, easy and fast nowadays. You can't put that genie back in the bottle.  Similarly copying and transfering our private data is also getting cheaper, easier and faster every day.

I don't think that my private data will end up exclusively at the NSA. Some of it may have already reached UK or Australia, most of it will probably end up everywhere eventually. Because leaking, selling or stealing it is also getting cheaper, easier and faster. There are some *regimes* close to my nations borders that I am much more worried about than USA, UK or Australia.

I think **gathering** data is a big part of the privacy problem that may be solved or improved. I try to avoid exposing my own private data as much as I can. I avoid Facebook and Google, personalized discount cards, stick to [free software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software), etc.. I am always looking into what else I could do.

I also think privacy conscious organizations (like the [Mozilla Foundation](https://mozilla.org/)) should lead others by avoiding to gather information about me.

But I received this message <strike>today</strike> **a couple of days ago** from Mozilla, full of tracking links and images. See for yourself:

The personalized links are in the HTML part of the message. It is funny that Thunderbird displays the full personalized link in the statusbar, even though they tried to disguise it with a `title="..."` attribute:

I am sure there are good reasons for tracking how many of the recipients read the message or which link they clicked. But knowing that this data of your users will be easy to get and use by third parties for something that may be contrary to your user interests â€“ would you still do it?
