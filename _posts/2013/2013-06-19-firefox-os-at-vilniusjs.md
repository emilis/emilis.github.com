I will be making a presentation about [Firefox OS](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/partners/#os) and my experience developing [my app](https://github.com/emilis/worldradioplayer) on it for a [local JavaScript developer community](http://vilniusjs.lt/) in Vilnius, Lithuania on June 25th, 2013.

If you will be nearby, I invite you to visit ( [register here](https://tito.io/vilniusjs/vilniusjs-6) ). There is usually free beer afterwards ;-).

I will try to summarize my experience building [the app](https://github.com/emilis/worldradioplayer) in a post on this blog before the presentation.
