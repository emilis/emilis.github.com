title: JavaScript is an amazing language
---

<p>When I changed jobs recently I bet on working as a JavaScript developer.</p>

<p>Part of my reasoning was that JavaScript is such a dynamic language that no matter what enterpricey or badly designed systems I will encounter, I will be able to program my way out of them and restore my sanity :-)</p>

<p>Today it seems to me that I must have been right.</p>

<p>On my new project I have to use a mix of <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a>, <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/">ExtJS</a> and <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/">ArcGIS</a> libraries. Let me say that I am not very impressed by ExtJS. It is too bloated for my tastes.</p>

<p>I also think that Dojo and ExtJS documentation are partially to blame for the fact that I found my colleagues code littered with object literals nesting 16+ levels deep. Because that's what you get if you start from a code examples in documentation [<small><a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dojo/declare.html">dojo.declare</a>, <a href="http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/docs/?class=Ext.Container">Ext.Container</a></small>].</p>

<p>But with JavaScript it's fixable. And function-level scoping is a very powerful tool.</p>

<p>That's what I did to refactor the code:</p>

<h3>Fix #1: Self-executing anonymous functions instead of object literals</h3>

<p>Lets say we have this module definition in code:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">{
    method1: function(params) {
        // some code
    },
    
    method2: function(params) {
        // some code
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Looks nice until the methods grow big with UI element definitions, event handlers, etc.. Then you have a mess.</p>

<p>So I changed it to this:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">(function() {
    
    // I chose "exports" for similarity to CommonJS:
    var exports = {};
    
    exports.method1 = function(params) {
        // some code
    };
    
    exports.method2 = function(params) {
        // some code
    };
    
    // Bonus: private static vars.
    var internalVar;
    
    // Bonus: private static functions.
    function internalFunction() {
        // some code
    }
    
    return exports;

})();
// This calls the function we just created
// and returns its result (exports object).</code></pre>

<p>Seems longer but it is better structured, reduces deep nesting and lets you hide some vars and functions inside the module.</p>


<h3>Fix #2: <em>that = this</em> and closures</h3>

<p>Dojo includes a nice mechanism for injecting scope into functions: <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dojo/hitch.html">dojo.hitch()</a>.</p>

<p>However I found this abused in our code. So I remembered the good old trick and used it instead:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">exports.someMethod = function() {
    
    var that = this;
    ...
    
    var someEventHandler = function() {
        
        // We need to go deeper:
        var anotherEventHandler = function() {
            
            that.callSomeOtherMethod();
            // At this level it saved me
            //  2 calls to dojo.hitch().
        }
    }
    ...
    
}</code></pre>


<h3>Fix #3: you can use functions before you define them</h3>

<p>I needed to write code for a widget. The code involved Model definition (<a href="http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/docs/?class=Ext.data.JsonStore">Ext.data.JsonStore</a>), View definition (<a href="http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/docs/?class=Ext.XTemplate">Ext.XTemplate</a>) and widget definition:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">exports.createMyWidget = function() {
    
    // Model (not shown)
    // View (not shown)
    
    // Widget mixed with event handlers:
    return Ext.Container({
        ...
        listeners: {
            click: function() {
                // lots of event handling here
            }
        }
    });
}</code></pre>

<p>The "click" and other event handlers didn't look nice enough, so I decided to move them into separate functions. And I did. To preserve code reading flow I moved them below the return statement:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">exports.createMyWidget = function() {
        
    // Model (not shown)
    // View (not shown)
    
    // Widget:
    return Ext.Container({
        ...
        listeners: {
            click: onClick // defined below
        }
    });
    
    // Event handlers:
    function onClick() {
        // lots of event handling here
    }
}</code></pre>


<p>Seems like a trivial thing, but very nice. Now I feel more confident about managing complexity in my work.</p>

<p>The only thing that can still slow me down? The same zombie that haunts every web developer: <a href="http://robertnyman.com/javascript/">Internet Explorer</a>.</p>
