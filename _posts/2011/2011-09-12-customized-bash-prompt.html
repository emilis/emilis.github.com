title: One Little Customization to One Mans Bash Prompt...
---

<p>I see there have been a number Bash tips posts on Hacker News recently.</p>
<p>Let me share an improvement for the shell I made myself only lately.</p>

<h3>Grand Design</h3>

<p>First a little explanation: I have a vision of how I would like my terminal application to look like:</p>

<p><a href="/projects/terminal.html"><img src="/projects/terminal/design.png"></a></p>

<p><em>This design would work very well with the overall UI configuration on my Ubuntu box (I have taskbar on the left, use Tree Style Tabs for Firefox, Zim desktop wiki).</em></p>

<h3>Pathetic Implementation</h3>

<p>My problem is that I don't have the necessary time and GUI development experience to implement this myself.</p>

<p>So a couple of weeks ago I made myself a crutch -- tweaked my Bash prompt. It now looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/projects/terminal/current.png"></p>

<p>Although I didn't add much (just a separator line and bold style for command text) it took me some time to play with various colours and styles to achieve this effect.</p>

<h3>The Code</h3>

<p>I have put the configuration file on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/emilis/emilis-config/blob/master/.bash_ps1">here</a>.</p>

<p>I saved the file in my HOME directory and link it from <a href="https://github.com/emilis/emilis-config/blob/master/.bashrc">my .bashrc</a> like this:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">if [ -f "$HOME/.bash_ps1" ]; then
    . "$HOME/.bash_ps1"
fi
</code></pre>
                        
<h3>Words of wisdom</h3>

<p>I bet some of you will now go and play with your Bash prompt configuration. Let me offer you a comment by some unnamed Ubuntu/Debian maintainer wizards I found while playing with my .bashrc:</p>

<blockquote># uncomment for a colored prompt, if the terminal has the capability; turned off by default to not distract the user: <em>the focus in a terminal window should be on the output of commands, not on the prompt</em><br>
# force_color_prompt=yes
</blockquote>
