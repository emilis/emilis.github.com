title: Notes from discussion on "Usefulness of inventing programming languages"
---

<p>Yesterday I submitted a link to my <a href="/2011/04/12/usefullnes-of-inventing-languages.html">previous post</a> to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">HackerNews</a> and someone was kind enough to submit it to <a href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit's</a> <a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming/">/r/programming</a> and other developer forums all over the web.</p>

<p>I was happy to see the interest of the hacker/programmer community in <a href="/projects/humble.html">Humble</a>. Many people found it interesting or inspiring. I also received some well articulated criticism, suggestions and links.</p>

<p>I don't know how much time I will be able to spend improving Humble (if any). So, for future reference, I want to document some of the links and notes that people provided in comments on this blog, HN, Reddit and elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
    <li><p>The idea of using a table to represent a function implementation was obviously proposed before me by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Parnas">David Parnas</a>, but in the context of software documentation.</p><ul>
        <li>A recent publication on this: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2008.11.001" title="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2008.11.001">Parnas D., Document based rational software development, Journal of Knowledge-Based Systems, 22(3):132-141, 2009.</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/%7Eley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Parnas:David_Lorge.html" title="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Parnas:David_Lorge.html">More publications by D. Parnas</a></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>A few people agreed that we lack tools to program on tablets and other touch-controlled devices. I hope someone will start thinking about this.</p></li>
    <li><p>The concept of separating code structure from its presentation seems to have potential. Although it may be hard to achieve this in Humble since the introduction of tables.</p></li>
    <li><p>Some people had traumatic experiences with using <em>relational</em> tables to write code (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Installer">MSI installers</a>).</p></li>
    <li><p>It seems I had errors in 99bottles and even FizzBuzz code :-)</p></li>
</ul>
