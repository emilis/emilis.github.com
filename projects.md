## APIs


### [![Good Job](/files/screenshots/good-job.png) Good Job](http://emilis.github.io/good-job/)
    
A way to write complex asynchronous code using Make inspired code structures.

The package is tested with Node.js, but it should also work on other JavaScript platforms.

### [![ObjectFS](/files/screenshots/objectfs.png) ObjectFS](http://objectfs.org/)

A data storage API specification for JavaScript and other scripting languages.

I came up with the idea when having to juggle four different types of databases for KąVeikiaValdžia.lt.

### [![Humble programming language](/files/screenshots/humble.png) Humble programming language](/projects/humble.html)

This is an unfinished concept. A programming language. Source code is written as bullet-lists and tables on a web page.

I am writing a spec. I wrote a proof-of-concept translator for it in PHP in 2009.

The older version of the language with minimal documentation and implementation: [emilis.net/kitwiki/projects/humble](http://emilis.net/kitwiki/projects/humble).

### ![CTLF logo](/files/screenshots/ctl_logo.gif) Gluestick framework / CTLF

A micro-framework for PHP.

Basicly it is just a few functions for loading objects and a directory structure.

I have started it in 2005 and have been using it ever since. It is mature and stable now.

Some very early and unmaintained documentation for it [on SourceForge](http://ctlf.sourceforge.net/).

Source code in [~emilis-d/+junk/libgluestick](https://code.launchpad.net/~emilis-d/+junk/libgluestick) branch on Launchpad.

## Libraries, Tools and Utilities


### [![QuXmlA -- Quick Xml Analyzer](/files/screenshots/quxmla.png) QuXmlA -- Quick Xml Analyzer](http://github.com/emilis/quxmla)
A script that produces simple stats about tag paths in the given XML files.

Uses SAX parser so very handy for analyzing huge files before parsing.

### [![XWinLogger](/files/screenshots/xwinlogger.png) XWinLogger](https://github.com/emilis/xwinlogger)

A bunch of scripts for Linux that log your currently active window and help you analyze the collected data.

I liked RescueTime, but it didn't satisfy all my needs so I wrote these scripts. After seeing how much private information there is in the log I will not use any external app for such tasks ever.

* * *


### [![Extended Tango palette](/files/screenshots/tango-palette.png) Extended Tango palette](http://emilis.info/other/extended_tango/)

A palette with 29 extra colours added to Tango Icon Library palette.

I used RGB value graphs to fine-tune the shades.

### [![Apache Solr with Lithuanian language support](/files/screenshots/solr.jpg) Apache Solr with Lithuanian language support](https://github.com/emilis/solr-lt)

A pre-packaged Solr version with Lithuanian language support from [zmedelis/ltlangpack](https://github.com/zmedelis/ltlangpack).

I built the package, updated for new versions and added some quick documentation.
